# Switch to GBA converter

The original Game Boy Advance runs games at 59.7275 frames per second. This is the standard that has been used to time all GBA runs that have been performed. The Nintendo Switch Online GBA Emulator, however, runs games at 60 frames per second. This creates a slight time discripancy that should be accounted for to maintain competitive integrity. This script accomplishes that by simply converting the time achieved for a run on Switch to what the run would be on a GBA.

# How to run

Download the convert.exe program from the Releases section. 
Enter a run with the following format into the Initial Time box:
> H:MM:SS.CS
The converted time will be output, and that is the accurate time of the run.
